# Changelog 0.1.0-alpha.4

Build: `2026-01-05`

## 🐛 Bug Fixes

- **CI Build**: Fixed Tauri build error on CI for multi-architecture targets by ensuring all platform-specific UV binaries are downloaded and bundled (`resource path 'binaries/uv' doesn't exist` error resolved).

## ♻️ Refactoring

- **Build System**: Enhanced build script to download UV binaries for both aarch64 and x86_64 architectures on macOS, supporting cross-compilation workflows.
- **Binary Resolution**: Updated runtime binary resolution to select architecture-specific UV binaries based on target platform.
- **Resource Configuration**: Simplified bundle resources configuration to use glob pattern `binaries/*` for flexible binary inclusion.
