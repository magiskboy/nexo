# 0.1.0-beta.4

## Fixes

- **MCP Client**: Fixed "env: node: No such file or directory" error when running Node.js-based MCP servers (npx, npm) in production builds. The application now correctly adds the bundled Node.js bin directory to the PATH environment variable, allowing npx scripts to locate the node executable.
