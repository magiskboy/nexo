# Nexo v0.1.0-alpha.46

## Features

- Added automatic Node.js runtime detection for MCP servers. The app now prefers its bundled Node.js/npm/npx for running MCP servers if not specified otherwise.

## Fixes

- Fixed a bug where MCP server settings (headers and environment variables) were not being saved correctly due to empty field handling.

## Improvements

- Updated release workflow to include mandatory human-readable release notes in GitHub releases.
