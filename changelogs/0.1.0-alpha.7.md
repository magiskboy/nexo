# Changelog 0.1.0-alpha.7

## Improvements

- Optimized `uv` binary bundling: Now only bundles the architecture-specific binary for the target platform, reducing bundle size by avoiding redundant binaries for other architectures.
- Cleaned up `src-tauri/binaries` directory management during build.

## Fixes

- Fixed an issue where multiple `uv` binary files were being included in the final application bundle on macOS.
- Simplified `uv` path resolution in the backend.
