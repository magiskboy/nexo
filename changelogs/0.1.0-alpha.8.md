# Changelog 0.1.0-alpha.8

## 🚀 Improvements

- **Binary Size Optimization**: Reduced application size by optimizing the bundling of sidecar binaries.
  - Eliminated redundant architecture-specific `uv` binaries on macOS.
  - Saved approximately **87MB** of disk space per installation.
  - Unified binary naming convention to match standard tools (e.g., `uv` instead of architecture-prefixed names).

## 🛠 Fixes

- **Build System**: Fixed a critical issue in the build script that caused failures on Windows CI environments.
  - Corrected the resolution of binary names (adding `.exe` extension where necessary) when extracting archives.
  - Improved robustness of the `download_and_extract` logic.
