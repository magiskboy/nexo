# Agent Behavioral Rules

1. **Language**: Always answer the user in **Vietnamese**.
2. **Technical Content**: Use **English** for:
   - Code snippets
   - Git commit messages
   - File names
   - Variable/Function names
   - Strict technical terms (e.g., "Dependency Injection", "Race condition", "State Management") if the Vietnamese equivalent is ambiguous or less common.
3. **Best Practices**: When citing specific best practices or error messages, keep them in their original English form for accuracy.
